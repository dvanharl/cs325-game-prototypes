<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In the days of nuclear fallout scare behind humanity, zombies have become all but a nuisance to rid of.

Although after the seventh season of The Walking Dead, the public has been put on high alert to watch out for any zombie in the area, to imprison, or possibly shoot them on site. Help Mash find a sizable meal while avoiding the authorities!
