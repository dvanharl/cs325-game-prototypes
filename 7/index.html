<h2>Brain Rush!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect as many brains as you can while avoiding getting caught by the police!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Based off Physical Prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Random police scan times. Speed determined by speed of sound gain.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Controls: Hold Z to hide. You'll come out when you let go of the key. If the police pass by when you're not hiding, the game ends, and you'll be sent back to the main menu.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Patience game that builds into higher required focus as the game progresses.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In the city.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
In the days of nuclear fallout scare behind humanity, zombies have become all but a nuisance to rid of. Although unlike common ones seen on television, Mash has a bit of sense, hiding out and getting brains where it best suits him, even rotten (he's not very picky). Although after the seventh season of The Walking Dead, the public has been put on high alert to watch out for any zombie in the area, to imprison, or possibly shoot them on site. Help Mash find a sizable meal while avoiding the authorities!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Zombie fanatics.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Can go from seconds to minutes; depends on the player's skill and will to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Listening carefully for the sounds of the police to anticipate their arrival for scanning.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
