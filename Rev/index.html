A simple girl bursting with vivacity, her life was cut short on a simple errand through the forest due to a tragic run in with the undead. Howver, a mysterious energy reanimated her body, to the envy of all other undead. Although now one of them, she rejects their ways, and will avenge her own death by using this magical energy to keep them at bay until the sun vanquishes their vulnerable incorporeal bodies.

Moving is helpful to waste the clock and not have to worry about shooting the enemies. Alternatively, one could continue to shoot the enemies and keep them at bay, especially with the increasing number near the end, which makes avoiding them much harder.
