What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A forest in France, abound with the souls of the undead.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A simple girl bursting with vivacity, her life was cut short on a simple errand through the forest due to a tragic run in with the undead. Howver, a mysterious energy reanimated her body, to the envy of all other undead. Although now one of them, she rejects their ways, and will avenge her own death by using this magical energy to keep them at bay until the sun vanquishes their vulnerable incorporeal bodies.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those perhaps with an interest in avoidance, shooting enemies, or the maccabre.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
~1-2 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Moving is helpful to waste the clock and not have to worry about shooting the enemies. Alternatively, one could continue to shoot the enemies and keep them at bay, especially with the increasing number near the end, which makes avoiding them much harder.
